Ludum Dare 48 entry! I made it in time to have it considered as a Compo entry. There's no music or sound effects,
so I have to opt out of those categories.

A sci-fi game where you attempt to delve deeper and deeper into a fortress by hacking
terminals on each level while fighting off enemies. As you go deeper and deeper there
will be more monsters and they will fly faster.

The HTML5 build of this can be played directly from github:

INSTRUCTIONS
============

WASD - movement
H - hack the terminal when it's found
space - attack with a sword

Joysticks may work too, but this was untested.
