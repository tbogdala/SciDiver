SciDiver

Ludum Dare 48 entry! I made it in time to have it considered as a Compo entry. There's no music or sound effects,
so I have to opt out of those categories.

A sci-fi game where you attempt to delve deeper and deeper into a fortress by hacking
terminals on each level while fighting off enemies.

The HTML5 build of this should hopefully be accessible on github under the *docs* folder.
